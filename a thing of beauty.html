A thing of beauty, is joy forever.<br>
Its loveliness increase; it will never <br>
pass into nothingness; But still will keep<br>
A bower quite for us and a sleep<br>
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quite breating.<br>
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing<br>
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,<br>
Spite of despondense, of the inhuman dreth<br>
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,<br>
Of all the unhealthy and o'er darkened ways<br>
Made for our searching: yes, inspite of all,<br>
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall<br>
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon<br>
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon,<br>
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils<br>
With the green world they live in; and clear rills <br>
That for themselves a cooling covert make<br>
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest breake,<br>
Rich with sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:<br>
And such too is the granduer of the dooms<br>
We have imagined for the mighty dead;<br>
All lovely tales that we have heared or read:<br>
An endless fountain of immortal drink,<br>
Pouring unto us from the heavens brink.<br><br>
